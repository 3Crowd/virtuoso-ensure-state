README for Virtuoso-ensure-state
=============================
Virtuoso-ensure-state is a program which converges virtual machines into a certain state. Essentially,
it's an easy way to specify a state machine to ensure that your virtual machine remain in a state you
control.

Example
=======
./virtuoso-ensure-state -b virtualbox -m myvirtualmachine --ifpowered_off start --ifpaused resume --no-gui --silent

would silently start the virtualbox based virtual machine if it were powered off and would resume it if it were paused, and would
attempt to start it in the background in a non-gui mode.
